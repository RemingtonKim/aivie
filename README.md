# ***aivie***

*aivie* is a project that aims to generate literature and visual art. Poems have been generated randomly through the assignment of words to a given parts-of-speech structure. More information about this process is located [here](./src_poem/INFO.md). The visual art has been generated using the [Cycle-GAN] architecture. More information about this process is located [here](./src_generation/INFO.md).

## Examples

<br>
Where it sings?
<br>
How the forest dearly defies
<br>
Who joins!
<br>
Uselessly within the lighthouse
<br>
Cerulean butterfly absorbs
<br>
Silently frightens over the imitation
<br>
It obeys
<br>
It runs
<br>
Native wind adds
<br>

<br>
Why its cave begins? <br>
They continue yet seriously fix
<br>
How you look zealous
<br>
Feel deplorable
<br>
Who ascends?
<br>
You are migratory?
