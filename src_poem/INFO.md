## How it Works

For *aivie*, poems were generated by taking various parts of speech structures and randomly assigning words to each part of speech. So, for example, this parts of speech structure:

```
ADJ NOUN | VERB ADVERB | PREPO ARTICLE NOUN
```
could generate the poem:
```
deft wind
crawls vainly
beyond the smoke
```
With more complex parts of speech structures and a large vocabulary, many unique, coherent poems can be generated.

## Dependencies
The major libraries used in the poem generation aspect of *aivie* are `pattern`, `nltk`, and `inflect`. These libraries were used to help in conjugating verbs so that poems would be grammatically correct.
